# Speeder's Configurable Improved Sprinklers
 
This is a mod for the game [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/), it improves the existing sprinklers and let you configure them to your liking.

The config hotkey is "K", you can edit it in your config file. Sadly, there is no way to edit the hotkey in-game (yet).

As for how the mod works: It adds extra watering area to the existing sprinklers, it can't remove watering area from the existing sprinklers though.

The idea for this mod originally was only to improve the normal sprinkler, that is pretty terrible, and for optimal use requires a non-standard farm organization that cause collision issues with the main character.

The 1.x version was rewritten entirely for this 2.0 release, to support future sprinkler mods, UI-based configuration, and other nice features, including autobalance.

## Features

* Default sprinkler shapes allow more flexibility in farm layouts.
* You can use any shape you want, literally.
* Infinite sprinkler range (requires editing the config file manually though, not recommended).
* Automatic balancing, sprinkler monetary value, and crafting cost increase as you increase the sprinkler area, ensuring the game stay balanced.
* You CAN cheat though, in two different ways, but I won't explain how, this is for the more adventurous people to mess with.

## Usage

Press K, edit what you want, and click OK.

Examples of what can be done:

Circle

Butterfly Shape (like real world sprinklers)

The sprinklers activate at night, like the normal game rules.
