**Better Sprinklers** by Maurício Gomes (Speeder) is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/)
mod which lets you edit sprinkler coverage (while adjusting their crafting cost), and lets you view
a sprinkler's or scarecrow's coverage by pointing at it in `F3` mode.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
